              Sangha House LA was founded as an intentional community in the Plum Village tradition in April 2025. In other words, we are a baby! But we are also a growing and thriving community. We have a weekly meditation on Wednesday evenings at 7 pm. We regularly host special events, such as laughter yoga, seasonal rituals, film screenings, and <a href="https://sanghahousela.substack.com/p/winter-happenings-at-sangha-house" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:text-indigo-600">mindful parties</a>, which we typically announce on <a href="https://www.instagram.com/sanghahousela/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:text-indigo-600">Instagram</a> and in our <a href="https://sanghahousela.substack.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:text-indigo-600">email newsletter</a>. We are currently co-organizing <a href="https://www.walkforpeacela.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:text-indigo-600">Walk for Peace LA</a>.

              We aim to cultivate the energy of the monastery in the heart of the city.

              We have been transformed by and are committed to mindfulness and compassion, and we believe that community — relationship — is essential to healing. Isn't it a surprise when you realize that it's not just that you need community to keep yourself consistent and disciplined in your practice? Community, relationship, is the real place of practice! As Buddha told Ananda, friendship is the whole of the path. And so we love the saying from Thich Nhat Hahn, "The next Buddha may be a Sangha."

              We are in the process of <a href="https://sanghahousela.substack.com/p/visioning-sangha-house-20" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="underline hover:text-indigo-600">envisioning a life for this community</a> beyond its infancy. This includes spelling out its basic commitments, as well as its mission in and service to the larger sangha, the movement for justice and healing, and the whole Earth community. If you want to be part of that discussion, please reach out to join us.
